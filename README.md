## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/THE-AAV/AI-financial-advisor.git
cd AI-financial-advisor
```

### 2. Run locally
Open `index.html` in your browser, or start a local server:
```bash
python -m http.server 8000
```
Then visit `http://localhost:8000`.

---

## 🧪 How It Works
1. User enters financial details (income, expenses, savings goals).  
2. The AI module analyzes inputs using simple decision-making models.  
3. Personalized recommendations are generated (e.g., budgeting tips, savings strategies).  

---

## 🔗 Example Flow
```
User Input: "I earn ₹50,000/month and spend ₹30,000."
↓
AI Output: "You can save ₹20,000 monthly. Consider investing 40% in mutual funds and 60% in fixed deposits."
```
